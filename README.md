Migrator
=====================================

Overview
--------
A tool to migrate data from (potentially) an arbitrary source database to an arbitrary destination database.
This solution is developed particularly to migrate ADT data from the legacy MS Access database to the new 
FDT MySQL platform. The solution is expected (or maybe just intended) to grow into a reasonably generic database
migration tool.
